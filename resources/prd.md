# ðŸ“… QuickAppointment - Universal Service Booking App PRD

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Solo service providers (fitness trainers, tutors, barbers, consultants, therapists) struggle with manual scheduling that leads to double bookings, constant phone interruptions during work sessions, and time wasted on back-and-forth scheduling calls.

### Solution Overview
QuickAppointment is a universal booking platform where any user can both offer services and book services from others. Unlike traditional provider-focused platforms, every user has a unified dashboard showing services they offer, bookings they've made, and bookings others have made with them. This creates a community-driven marketplace where users naturally switch between being providers and clients.

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Freelance service providers who also consume services (fitness trainers who book massages, tutors who need haircuts)
- **Secondary**: Students and part-time workers who offer skills while booking other services
- **Tertiary**: Small business owners managing their own service offerings

### Success Definition
Users can seamlessly create services, discover and book services from others, and manage everything through one unified dashboard without scheduling conflicts or phone calls.

## 2. Feature Specifications

### Feature 1: User Authentication & Profile Management
**User Story:** "As a user, I want to create one account that lets me both offer services and book services so that I don't need multiple platforms."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can register with email, password, name, and phone
- User can login/logout with JWT token authentication
- User can update their profile with bio and contact information
- User session persists across browser sessions
- Password validation requires 8+ characters

**Technical Complexity:** 1 (Standard authentication pattern)
**Implementation Notes:** Use Flask-JWT-Extended for token management, bcrypt for password hashing

### Feature 2: Service Creation & Management
**User Story:** "As a service provider, I want to create services with pricing and duration so that clients can book them online."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can create services with name, duration (30min/45min/1hr/2hr), price, description
- User can edit or deactivate their services
- Services display provider name and contact information
- Duration options are predefined dropdown selections
- Price is display-only (no payment processing)

**Technical Complexity:** 2 (CRUD operations with relationships)
**Implementation Notes:** Use SQLAlchemy relationships between users and services

### Feature 3: Time Slot Management & Availability
**User Story:** "As a service provider, I want to set my available time slots so that clients can only book when I'm free."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Provider can create time slots for their services by date and start time
- Time slots automatically calculate end time based on service duration
- Slots can be marked as available or unavailable
- No overlapping bookings for the same provider
- Default view shows next 14 days

**Technical Complexity:** 2 (Date/time logic with conflict prevention)
**Implementation Notes:** Use PostgreSQL datetime fields, implement booking conflict validation

### Feature 4: Service Discovery & Booking
**User Story:** "As a client, I want to browse all available services and book appointments so that I can easily find what I need."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can view all active services from all providers
- User can see available time slots for each service
- User can book available slots (becomes unavailable after booking)
- User cannot book their own services
- Booking confirmation shows all relevant details

**Technical Complexity:** 2 (Search/filter logic with booking validation)
**Implementation Notes:** Implement service filtering, prevent self-booking, atomic booking operations

### Feature 5: Unified Dashboard & Notifications
**User Story:** "As a user, I want one dashboard showing all my activities so that I can manage both sides of my service interactions."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard shows: services I offer, my upcoming bookings (as client), bookings others made with me (as provider)
- Real-time notifications when someone books my services
- Notification list shows unread/read status
- Dashboard updates without page refresh
- Clear visual separation between provider and client activities

**Technical Complexity:** 2 (Complex data aggregation and real-time updates)
**Implementation Notes:** Use React Context for state management, implement notification system with read/unread tracking

3. User sets available time slots for the next 2 weeks
4. Another user discovers the service
5. Other user books an available slot
6. Original user receives booking notification
7. Both users see booking in their dashboard

#### Secondary Flow: Book Service as Client
1. User logs in to dashboard
2. User browses available services
3. User clicks on interesting service
4. User views available time slots
5. User selects and confirms booking
6. User sees confirmation and booking appears in dashboard
7. Provider receives notification

#### Secondary Flow: Manage Services and Bookings
1. User accesses unified dashboard
2. User reviews: offered services, client bookings, provider bookings
3. User can edit service details or availability
4. User can view booking details and contact information
5. User marks notifications as read

### Error/Edge Cases
- **No available slots:** Show "No availability" message with contact provider option

## 6. Risk Mitigation & Contingencies

### High-Risk Elements

#### 1. Time Slot Conflict Prevention
**Risk:** Multiple users booking the same slot simultaneously
**Mitigation:** Database constraints + atomic transactions
**Fallback:** Manual conflict resolution with user notification

#### 2. Real-time Dashboard Updates
**Risk:** Complex state management across multiple data sources
**Mitigation:** React Context API with optimistic updates
**Fallback:** Manual refresh button for dashboard data

#### 3. Responsive Dashboard Layout
**Risk:** Complex three-column layout on mobile devices
**Mitigation:** CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints
**Fallback:** Simple stacked layout with tab navigation

### Scope Reduction Strategy

#### Must-Have Features
- User authentication and profile management
- Basic service creation and discovery
- Simple booking system with availability checking
- Dashboard showing user's activities

#### Should-Have Features
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced time slot management
- Responsive mobile design
- Error handling and validation

#### Could-Have Features
- Service categories and filtering
- User reviews and ratings
- Email notifications
- Booking cancellation system
- Payment integration
- Calendar integration

### Timeline Buffers
- **Phase 1-2:** If database setup takes longer, use SQLite for development
- **Phase 3:** If responsive design is complex, focus on desktop-first approach
- **Phase 4:** If integration issues arise, implement core flows first
- **Phase 5:** If deployment is complex, provide local setup instructions

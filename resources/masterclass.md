- **Backend** (The brain): Flask + Python
- **Database** (Where data lives): PostgreSQL
- **Styling** (How it looks): CSS

### How Web Apps Work (Simple Overview)

Imagine a restaurant:

```
üë§ CUSTOMER (User)          üçΩÔ∏è WAITER (Frontend)          üë®‚Äçüç≥ CHEF (Backend)          üìã RECIPES (Database)
   Orders food         ‚Üí      Takes order to kitchen   ‚Üí     Cooks the food      ‚Üí      Looks up recipes
   Gets food          ‚Üê      Brings food back         ‚Üê     Gives finished dish ‚Üê      Uses stored recipes
```

![Web App Diagram](diagram.png)


In web apps:
- **Frontend**: What you see and click (like the waiter)
- **Backend**: Processes requests and data (like the chef)
- **Database**: Stores information (like recipe book)

### Your Project Setup

When you start a new project, your folders will look like this:

```
my-awesome-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .cursor/                 # Settings for AI helper
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/                 # Server code (the brain)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blueprints/         # Different features (like login, user profile)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/               # Instructions for testing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py           # App settings
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database.py         # Database setup
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py             # Main app file
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # List of tools needed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/               # User interface (what people see)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/              # Helpful documents and templates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Project description
```

**Why This Setup is Great:**
- **Organized**: Everything has its place
- **AI-Friendly**: Cursor can easily understand and help

2. Download the Community Edition (it's free)
3. Install following the setup wizard
4. We'll connect it to your database later

### Setup Local PostgreSQL Database (Using Docker)

**What is Docker Compose?**
It's a tool that lets you run a PostgreSQL database on your computer without installing it directly. Perfect for development!

**Prerequisites:**
- Install Docker Desktop from [docker.com](https://docker.com)
- Make sure Docker is running

**Start Your Local Database:**

1. **Open Terminal in Your Project Folder:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project root (where you extracted the template)
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. **Navigate to Backend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend/docs
   ```
   
   **Note**: The `docker-compose.yml` file is located in `backend/docs/` directory in your template project.

3. **Start the Database:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This creates:
   - **PostgreSQL Database** on port 5432
   - **pgAdmin** (web interface) on port 8080

4. **Verify It's Running:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
   You should see both services running

**Access Your Database:**

**Option 1: pgAdmin (Web Interface)**
- Open browser: http://localhost:8080
- Login: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`
- Add server connection:
  - Host: `postgres`
  - Port: `5432`
  - Database: `vcp_database`
  - Username: `vcp_user`
  - Password: `vcp_password`

**Option 2: DBeaver**
- Create new PostgreSQL connection
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `5432`
- Database: `vcp_database`
- Username: `vcp_user`
- Password: `vcp_password`

1. **Create Database Models (20 minutes)**
   - Build models for each type of data (users, posts, etc.)
   - Include relationships between different data types
   - Add timestamps (when created, when updated)
   - Make sure models support all features in your PRD

2. **Use the Migration System (10 minutes)**
   - **Always use our custom migration script** - never use Flask-Migrate directly
   - The migration script makes database changes easy and safe
   
   ```bash
   # Create and apply your database changes
   python migrate.py "Create initial database tables"
   
   # Check what migrations exist
   python migrate.py --status
   
   # Apply any pending changes
   python migrate.py --upgrade
   ```

3. **Check Your Database (10 minutes)**
   - Run your app to make sure database starts correctly
   - Open DBeaver to see your tables
   - Verify all tables and relationships are correct

### **WORKSHOP ACTIVITY 6: Building Your Backend (The Brain of Your App)**

**Goal**: Build the server-side logic that handles all your app's functionality, organized by feature groups

**What You'll Do:**
Create the backend endpoints (API routes) that your frontend will use to get and save data. You'll work on related features together as "collections."

**The Step-by-Step Pattern:**

**For Each Collection of Features:**

1. **Build Related Endpoints (30-45 minutes per collection)**
   - Start with User Management (register, login, profile)
   - Create all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Add proper error handling and validation
   - Use consistent response formats

2. **Test in Postman (15 minutes per collection)**
   - Create a Postman collection for these endpoints
   - Test every endpoint thoroughly
   - Try good data and bad data
   - Make sure error messages are helpful
   - Save examples of successful requests

3. **Connect to Frontend (30 minutes per collection)**
   - Replace fake data with real API calls
   - Add loading messages while waiting for data
   - Handle errors gracefully (show user-friendly messages)
   - Test the complete user experience

4. **Move to Next Collection**
   - Repeat the same pattern for next group of features
   - Keep going until all PRD features are built

**Example Collections:**
- **User Management**: Register, login, profile, logout
- **Main Features**: Based on your specific app (posts, expenses, recipes, etc.)
- **Data Management**: Create, edit, delete your app's main content
- **Extra Features**: Search, filtering, user preferences

**Development Pattern:**
```
Build Endpoints ‚Üí Test in Postman ‚Üí Connect to Frontend ‚Üí Repeat for Next Collection
```

**Key Success Principles:**
- **One Collection at a Time**: Finish each group completely before moving on
- **Test Everything**: Every endpoint must work perfectly in Postman first
- **Connect Immediately**: Link frontend to backend after each collection
- **Test User Experience**: Make sure the complete flow feels good

**Success Criteria for Each Collection:**
- [ ] All endpoints work correctly in Postman
- [ ] Frontend successfully uses the new endpoints
- [ ] Error handling works (shows helpful messages)
- [ ] Loading states work (users see progress)
- [ ] User experience feels smooth and professional

---

### **WORKSHOP ACTIVITY 7: Connecting Everything Together**

**Goal**: Make sure your complete app works perfectly from start to finish

**What You'll Do:**
Test your entire app like a real user would, fix any remaining issues, and polish the experience.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **End-to-End Testing (30 minutes)**
   - Go through every user journey from your PRD
   - Try to break things on purpose (enter weird data, click rapidly, etc.)
   - Test on different devices and screen sizes
   - Make sure error messages are helpful and friendly

2. **Polish User Experience (15 minutes)**
   - Check loading times (should feel fast)
   - Ensure loading messages appear when needed
   - Verify responsive design works on mobile
   - Make final tweaks to colors, spacing, and text

3. **Final Bug Fixes (15 minutes)**
   - Fix any issues you discovered during testing
   - Clean up any messy code
   - Make sure everything follows your design standards

**Things to Test:**
- **User Registration**: Can new users sign up successfully?
- **User Login**: Do existing users get logged in correctly?
- **Main Features**: Does every key feature work as planned?
- **Error Handling**: What happens when things go wrong?
- **Mobile Experience**: Does it work well on phones?
- **Data Persistence**: Is information saved correctly?

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All PRD features work correctly
- [ ] Complete user journeys feel smooth
- [ ] App looks professional and polished
- [ ] Works well on different devices
- [ ] Error handling is user-friendly
- [ ] App feels fast and responsive

- Test individual endpoints in Postman
- Make sure your database is running
- Ask Cursor to review your code

**When Frontend and Backend Don't Talk:**
- Check that API URLs are correct
- Verify request and response formats match
- Look for CORS errors (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- Make sure authentication is working
- Test the same request in Postman first

**General Problem-Solving:**
1. **Read the Error Message**: Error messages usually tell you what's wrong
2. **Ask Cursor for Help**: Copy the error and ask for assistance
3. **Test Small Parts**: Isolate the problem to find the exact issue
4. **Take Breaks**: Sometimes stepping away helps you see the solution
5. **Use Google**: Many programming problems have been solved before

### **WORKSHOP ACTIVITY 8: Getting Ready to Launch**

**Goal**: Package your app and deploy it to the internet so others can use it

**What You'll Do:**
Create Docker containers (packages) for your app, upload to GitHub, and deploy to a cloud service.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Create Docker Packages (15 minutes)**
   - Use AI to generate Docker files for both frontend and backend
   - These files tell the internet server how to run your app
   - Test that packages build correctly on your computer

2. **Upload to GitHub (15 minutes)**
   - Create a GitHub repository (online code storage)
   - Upload all your code
   - This lets deployment services access your code

3. **Deploy to DigitalOcean (30 minutes)**
   - Connect your GitHub to DigitalOcean App Platform
   - Configure environment settings
   - Deploy both frontend and backend
   - Monitor deployment progress

4. **Test Everything (15 minutes)**
   - Visit your live app
   - Test all features work online
   - Check performance and speed
   - Celebrate your success! üéâ

### Creating Docker Files (App Packages)

**What is Docker?**
Think of Docker like a shipping container for your app. It packages everything your app needs to run, so it works the same everywhere.

**Backend Docker File** (Flask App):
```dockerfile
# Use Python as the base
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy your app code
COPY . .

# Expose port 5000
EXPOSE 5000

# Start your app
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

**Frontend Docker File** (React App):
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Build the app
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Serve stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=0 /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
```

### Upload Code to GitHub

**Why GitHub?**
GitHub is like Google Drive for code. It stores your code safely and lets deployment services access it.

**Steps:**
1. **Initialize Git** (version control):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial version of my app"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New Repository"
   - Name it (same as your project)
   - Make it public or private

3. **Upload Your Code**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin [your-github-url]
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Deploy to DigitalOcean

**What is DigitalOcean App Platform?**
It's a service that takes your code and makes it available on the internet automatically.

**Steps:**

1. **Connect GitHub Account**:
   - Go to [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps)
   - Create account if needed
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository

2. **Configure Your App**:
   - Choose your main branch (usually "main")
   - Set build settings (DigitalOcean usually detects these automatically)
   - Set environment variables (database URLs, secret keys)

3. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Create Resources"
   - Watch the deployment logs
   - Wait for "Deployment successful" message
   - Get your live app URL!

### Setting Up Your Website Address

Having your own domain name (like myawesomeapp.com) makes your app look professional!

#### Buying a Domain Name

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Go to GoDaddy.com**:
   - Visit [godaddy.com](https://godaddy.com)
   - Create an account or sign in

2. **Search for Your Domain**:
   - Type your desired domain name
   - Try variations if your first choice is taken
   - Good extensions: .com, .app, .dev, .io

3. **Purchase Your Domain**:
   - Add to cart
   - Choose 1-2 year registration
   - Consider domain privacy (hides your personal info)
   - Complete payment

#### Connecting Your Domain to DigitalOcean

**Why Do This?**
Instead of a complicated URL like `app-12345.ondigitalocean.app`, you'll have `yourdomain.com`.

**Steps:**

1. **Get DigitalOcean DNS Settings**:
   - In DigitalOcean, go to Networking ‚Üí Domains
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Enter your domain name
   - Copy the nameserver addresses (like ns1.digitalocean.com)

2. **Update GoDaddy Settings**:
   - In your GoDaddy account, go to "My Products"
   - Click "DNS" next to your domain
   - Find "Nameservers" section
   - Change to "Custom" nameservers
   - Enter the DigitalOcean nameservers
   - Save changes

3. **Configure DNS Records**:
   - Back in DigitalOcean DNS manager
   - Add A record: `@` points to your app's IP
   - Add CNAME record: `www` points to your domain
   - Save all settings

4. **Wait for Changes to Take Effect**:
   - DNS changes can take up to 48 hours
   - Usually works within a few hours
   - Use [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net) to check progress

5. **Enable HTTPS (Security)**:
   - DigitalOcean automatically provides SSL certificates
   - Your site will work with https://yourdomain.com
   - This makes it secure and trusted

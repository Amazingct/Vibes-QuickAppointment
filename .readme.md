# Vibe Coding Masterclass — Build and Deploy in 2 Days

**Dates:** September 12–13, 2025  
**Format:** 2-Day Virtual (Live via Google Meet)  
**Instructor:** Daniel Ogunlolu (Founder of CurateLearn & Full-stack AI Engineer/Developer)  
**Certificate:** Comes with a certificate of attendance  

## Overview
Learn by Building. Deploy by Doing. This isn’t another theory-heavy session. It’s a fully practical masterclass where we go from idea → design → vibe coding → a production-ready app in just two days.

## Agenda
Over the course of two days, you’ll:
- Vote on which web application to build.
- Build both backend and frontend services from scratch.
- Learn the art of vibe coding (context engineering for AI-assisted coding): move fast from concept to design to code with clarity and confidence.
- Learn how to use the Cursor AI IDE like a professional.
- Deploy your app live during the class so everyone can use it right away.
- Leave with not just knowledge, but a working system you helped create.

## Why Join?
- **100% Virtual & Hands-On:** Learn from anywhere, but build like you’re in the same room.
- **Collaborative Learning:** Work alongside peers in real-time, share insights, and troubleshoot together.
- **End-to-End Experience:** Idea validation → System Design → Coding → Deployment → Production.
- **Code Access for Everyone:** All code written during the class will be shared with every participant.
